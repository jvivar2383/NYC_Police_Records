# NYC_Police_Records
This repository will investingate and plot the data from <a href="https://www.50-a.org/about">50-a.org <a> to a more digestable format. 
The idea is to make the data more accessible to everyone and that the public become more aware of the police in their precints in NYC. 
This is an independent work done by me and has no connection with 50-a.org.
